/*
IMPORTANCE!!! ------------------------------------------------
1) int& means : create an alias name to an existing variable.
                In C++, we call this alias name as 'reference'

2) a reference must be initialized / bound to some variable at declartion time.       
   And it can only be bound to some variable ONCE AND ONLY ONCE for its whole life at declare time.

IN SUMMARY: reference is just another name (alias) for an already existing object.
