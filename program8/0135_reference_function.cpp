/*
IMPORTANCE!!! -----------------------------------------------
When a called function defines its params as reference:
1) the called function can work on params that have not been copied from the calling function.
2) This has significant performance improvements.


Reference vs Pointer:
1) Pointer can be NULL, refererence cannot be NULL.
2) Pointer can point to here and there, reference can only bound to 1 variable for its whole life.
3) Pointer use *pI to get the value, reference use as a normal variable, meaning reference is simpler.

IN SUMMARY: if you can use reference, then use reference.
